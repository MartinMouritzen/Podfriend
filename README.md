## The code is not working for me
Please open an issue, there's probably a lot of things that needs to be fixed and streamlined for it to work across more devices than just my own Windows machine and Mac laptop :)

## Why is the code so weird
The code grew from being a Desktop only podcast app, to including web and mobile. The mobile version started out as a React-Native solution, before moving to Cordova. This means that a lot of components are separated in 2 components, a logic component and a UI component, to reuse logic across mobile, web and desktop. This separation is not needed for the Cordova version, so I moved away from that pattern later, but because of time haven't had the chance to reimplement a lot of that logic.

To further make the code ugly, the project started out using React class components, before transitioning to functional components.
