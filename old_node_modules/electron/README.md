The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications
using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) and is used by the [Atom
editor](https://github.com/atom/atom) and many other [apps](https://electronjs.org/apps).

## Installation

To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
The preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your
app:

```sh
npm install electron --save-dev [--save-exact]
```

The `--save-exact` flag is recommended for Electron prior to version 2, as it does not follow semantic
versioning. As of version 2.0.0, Electron follows semver, so you don't need `--save-exact` flag. For info on how to manage Electron versions in your apps, see
[Electron versioning](docs/tutorial/electron-versioning.md).

For more installation options and troubleshooting tips, see
[installation](docs/tutorial/installation.md).

## Quick start & Electron Fiddle

Use [`Electron Fiddle`](https://github.com/electron/fiddle)
to build, run, and package small Electron experiments, to see code examples for all of Electron's APIs, and
to try out different versions of Electron. It's designed to make the start of your journey with
Electron easier.

Alternatively, clone and run the
[electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)
repository to see a minimal Electron app in action:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
cd electron-quick-start
npm install
npm start
```

## Programmatic usage

Most people use Electron from the command line, but if you require `electron` inside
your **Node app** (not your Electron app) it will return the file path to the
binary. Use this to spawn Electron from Node scripts:

```javascript
const electron = require('electron')
const proc = require('child_process')

// will print something similar to /Users/maf/.../Electron
console.log(electron)

// spawn Electron
const child = proc.spawn(electron)
```
