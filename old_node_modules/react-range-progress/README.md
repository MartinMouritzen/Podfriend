A visually customizable range input component for react, inspired by [a post on css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/custom-interactive-range-inputs/).

## Installation

```
npm install react-range-progress --save
```

You can also import from [npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com/react-range-progress) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/react-range-progress).

## Playground

You can play around with a few properties on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/JqRpW8Mw2)

## Props

`hideThumb` - Boolean: Set to true to hide the thumb.

## Disclaimer

This package main purpose was to teach myself about publishing a package on npm.
Now I see there are a few monthly downloads, I advise any user to look at the source before using this package. If you can just style a couple of divs into a range, do it instead. Styling a range input may be overkill to reach the desired goal.
